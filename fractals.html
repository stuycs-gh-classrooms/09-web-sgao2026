        <h1>Koch Curve</h1>
	<p>The Koch Curve consists of four Koch curves of the previous depth arranged with every interation of the previous depth forming one side of the Koch curve and a Koch curve depth of 1 being a straight, horizontal line</p>

	<h2>Koch Curve Modification</h2>
	<p>The Koch curve with each curve as a side of a trangle and the angles inverted, known as a Koch snowflake, and at the end of every depth 1 curve, the turtle also draws a modification of the tree fractal at a random angle</p>

        <h1>Sierpinski Triangle</h1>
	<p>The Sierpinski Triangle consists of 3 Sierpinski triangles of the previous depth--a depth 1 Sierpinski triangle being an equilateral triangle--arranged to form a larger triangle.</p>

	<h2>Sierpinski Triangle Modification</h2>
	<p>The width of the line increases as depth decreases and the color of the line depends on which side of the triangle the turtle is drawing.</p>

        <h1>Tree</h1>
	<p>The tree consists of three Trees of the previous depth--with a depth 1 tree being a straight line--with one tree vertical and the other two at the angle given to the function.</p>

	<h2>Tree Modification</h2>
	<p>The Tree except there are flowers of a random color and size at the ends of every depth 1 tree.</p>
