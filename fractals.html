        <h1>Koch Curve</h1>
	<p>The Koch Curve consists of four Koch curves of the previous depth arranged with every interation of the previous depth forming one side of the Koch curve and a Koch curve depth of 1 being a straigh, horizontal line</p>

	<h2>Koch Curve Modification</h2>
	<p>The Koch curve accept at the end of every depth 1 curve, the turtle also draws a modification of the tree fractal at a random angle</p>
